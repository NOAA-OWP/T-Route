The various datasets included here are generally extracts from the NWM input files.

The CONUS_FULL_RES file was generated from the RouteLink file in the parameter
archive and converted to a compressed NetCDF via the following command:
nccopy -d1 -s RouteLink_NWMv2.0_20190517_cheyenne_pull.nc RouteLink_NWMv2.0_20190517_cheyenne_pull.nc4s
See notes here: https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/workshops/2011/utilities/NccopyExamples.html

CONUS_Named_Streams was generated by intersecting the FULL_RES file with the GNIS named streams list. The named streams
don't extend to the end of the lines in the full resolution file in every case, so we used an automated procedure to 
push the name to the end of the line. Presently, there is nothing which uses the names in our exisiting scripts.
